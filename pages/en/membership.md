## Membership

We are a friendly community of nerds who are always happy to welcome new people! It does not matter whether you prefer coding, hands-on crafting, or programming your own hardware — our members work on all kinds of projects. Some primarily enjoy the hackerspace as a big shared living room. No matter if you are just getting started or have been doing your favourite things for decades: everyone is welcome and Netz39 is definitely a place for learning.

Why becoming a member is worth it:

- 24/7 access to our rooms after a short get-to-know period
- Free use of the full set of equipment without having to ask for permission
- Your own material or project box in our large shelving area
- Friendly people who are happy to share tips and tricks for your projects
- Opportunities to work on long-term projects together
- Supporting the continued existence and development of the hackerspace
- Membership fees are tax-deductible (we are a non-profit)

### Active membership

Active membership is open to natural persons (aka humans). The monthly fee is 30 €. Reduced fees are possible (for example for pupils and students) and start at 10 € per month — you can also pay more voluntarily.

- [Application form for active members](https://github.com/netz39/Mitgliedsantraege/releases/latest/download/aufnahmeantrag-aktiv.pdf)
- [SEPA direct debit mandate](https://github.com/netz39/Mitgliedsantraege/releases/latest/download/einzug.pdf)

### Supporting membership

If you like the idea of the hackerspace but do not need to use it yourself, you can become a supporting member (natural persons and legal entities). Supporting members do not have voting rights in the general assembly and do not receive keys to the space, but you are still welcome to use the rooms occasionally. Supporting membership for natural persons starts at 10 € per month. For more information, please send an email to vorstand(at)netz39.de.
