## Your rights as a data subject

You may exercise the following rights at any time using the contact details of our data protection contact provided above:

- Access to the data stored about you and how it is processed,
- Rectification of inaccurate personal data,
- Erasure of the data we store about you,
- Restriction of data processing if we are not yet allowed to delete your data due to legal obligations,
- Objection to the processing of your data by us, and
- Data portability, provided you have consented to the data processing or have concluded a contract with us.

If you have given us consent, you may withdraw it at any time with effect for the future.

You may also lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority responsible for you at any time. The competent authority depends on the German federal state of your residence, your place of work, or the alleged violation. A list of supervisory authorities (for the non-public sector) with their addresses can be found at: <https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html>.

## Purposes of data processing by the controller and third parties

We process your personal data only for the purposes described in this privacy policy. Your data will not be transferred to third parties for other purposes. We only share your personal data with third parties if:

- you have given your explicit consent,
- the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you,
- the processing is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation,
- the processing is necessary to safeguard legitimate interests, and
- there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding interest in your data not being disclosed.

## Deletion or blocking of the data

We follow the principles of data minimisation. We therefore store your personal data only for as long as is necessary to achieve the purposes stated here or as required by the various retention periods specified by law. Once the respective purpose no longer applies or these periods expire, the corresponding data will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the legal regulations.

## Cookies

Like many other websites, we also use so-called "cookies". Cookies are small text files that are transferred from a web server to your hard drive. This automatically provides us with certain data such as IP address, browser used, operating system and your connection to the internet.

Cookies cannot be used to launch programs or transmit viruses to a computer. On the basis of the information contained in cookies, we can make navigation easier for you and ensure the correct display of our website.

Under no circumstances will the data collected by us be passed on to third parties or linked to personal data without your consent.

Of course you can also view our website without cookies. Internet browsers are regularly set to accept cookies. In general you can deactivate the use of cookies at any time via your browser settings. Please use the help functions of your internet browser to learn how to change these settings. Please note that individual functions of our website may not work if you have deactivated the use of cookies.

## Changes to our privacy policy

We reserve the right to adapt this privacy policy so that it always complies with current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services in the policy, for example when introducing new services. The new privacy policy will then apply to your next visit.
