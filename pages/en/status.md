# Space status

The space status indicator shows whether our rooms are currently open. If the light is green you are welcome to drop by. If you want to make sure someone is around, arrange a meeting with a member or contact us through one of our [communication channels]({{ '/en/contact/' | relative_url }}).

- on the website header and in the wiki sidebar
- as a bookmarkable minimal version: <https://spaceapi.n39.eu/state.png>
- as an even more minimal text version: <https://spaceapi.n39.eu/text>
- or directly via the [SpaceAPI record](https://spaceapi.n39.eu/json)
