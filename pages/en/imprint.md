## Liability notice

### Liability for content

The contents of our pages were created with great care. However, we cannot guarantee the correctness, completeness or up-to-dateness of the contents. As service providers we are responsible for our own contents on these pages in accordance with general legislation pursuant to § 7 para. 1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG we are not obligated as service providers to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general legislation remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time we become aware of a specific infringement. If we become aware of such infringements, we will remove these contents immediately.

### Liability for links

Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware of legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.

### Copyright

The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution and any kind of utilisation outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the contents on this site were not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. Third-party content is particularly marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become aware of infringements, we will remove such content immediately.

### Data protection

The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. If personal data (for example name, address or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit consent.

We point out that data transmission on the internet (e.g. when communicating by email) may have security gaps. Complete protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible.

Further information, especially with regard to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), can be found at https://www.netz39.de/en/privacy/.

The use of contact data published in the context of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising information, such as spam emails.
